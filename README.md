# TaskAssigner


This is going to be a task/group assigner website that randomly assigns tasks/groups to people. It is currently at it's most basic
functionality. The tast viewer and task assigner are currently seperate entities and will stay that way unitl I add authentication to the task assigner. The task viewer can be found on www.pracprac.info

Still to do:

- Display warnings if there is more people than tasks and vice versa.
- Add authentication so that people can create their own events 
- Implement a search bar so people can look for their event and see what task has been assigned to them
